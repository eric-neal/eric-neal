 ## 👋 Hi, I’m Eric. 
I'm a 2023 graduate of the UMSL mathematics department. You will find here some repos of my code from courses and two of my personal projects, one of which a constant tuneup from CS4300 FALL 2021. 
## What I'm working on 
[_Predicting Win/Loss Likelihood of Home MLB Teams_](https://github.com/eric-neal/CS4300-AI) uses a neural network to analyze over 2,400 MLB games, a project from Intro. to AI that I took in Fall 2021 with Dr. Adhikari. _Handegg Reference_ implements graph theory in determining the [circle of parity](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/D3edSwVg0MY?feature=share) of individual NFL seasons.
