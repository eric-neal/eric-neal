 ## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eric. 
 
I am an undergrad at the University of Missouri - St. Louis majoring in Mathematics. 
I tutor high school through early college mathematics and computer science. 

Open source with Python or C/C++ are my jam. Always offering collaboration on small projects or to give feedback.  
I am ultimately interested in further education and research but am currently looking for full-time work in software engineering! 

## What I'm working on 
I have several projects posted from courses I am taking in my last year, including various algorithm analysis programs and a very simple neural network in an elective AI course. I also have been working on a sports parity website as an exploration of graph theory.
